# OraclProduction ![CI status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)
A project that will be creating a template in Java, for Oracle, to create and record all future production line items. The structure of the project must be flexible so it could be used in any production line. It will be easily modified to handle different products.For ease of use I made this program console based. Users of the program will be able to make products. The product can be some type of audio player or movie player. They will be able to give the product custom names, and check how many products were made and what type of products.

# Running the program

You will be prompted to enter a number between 1 to 3. If any other number is entered the program will exit. If no one products are made you will want to enter 1 where you will be prompted to enter a name for the product. Then you will be asked to enter if you would like to make it a movie player or audio player. From there you will enter certain specifications for whichever option you chose.

These are some websites I used to help me to create this program. Along with these websites, my classmate Brandon helped with certain steps, especially near the end.
